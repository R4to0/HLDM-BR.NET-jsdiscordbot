## WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Yet another discord bot made in NodeJS, written for use with HLDM-BR.NET
Sven Co-op servers.

Keep in mind that I (R4to0) learned nodejs while writing this, so the script
might be awful to read :)

Warning: Some comments are written in portuguese, total mess :) 

Required modules:
- [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)
- [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)
- [steamid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steamid)
- [steamapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steamapi)
- [sourcequery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sourcequery)
- [async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async)
- [fs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html)
- [tail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tail)

This script is currently being rewritten with ESM in mind, no ETA.
